# To Do

The project is bare-bones with just enough to make it work. Here is a 
list of things that is planned for the near future:

* Add more documentation to the bootstrap script to describe in detail
  why everything is setup the way it is.
* Add a recipes directory which will contain gulp file snippets to add 
  more features to the project.

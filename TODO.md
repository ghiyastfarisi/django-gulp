# To Do

The project is bare-bones with just enough to make it work. Here is a 
list of things we plan to do in the future:

* Add more documentation to the bootstrap script.
* Add a recipes directory which will contain gulp file snippets to add 
  more features to the project, eg. support for for SASS, minification,
  etc.

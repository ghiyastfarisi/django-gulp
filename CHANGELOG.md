# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).
The assumption is that the project will always be current so all the
changes are tracked with date stamps rather than versions. The repository
will be tagged with dates so you will be able to easily see what changed
between releases.
